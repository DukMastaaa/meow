### 1 Forgan Smith Building

I'm splitting this into East and West sides of the building.

#### E East Side

East side has a lot of history/philosophy stuff. There's a nice "library" area on level 3 that has a lot of History books you can read, but it isn't really a study area. There is an eating area somewhere here but I cannot locate it on the map - must explore again in person.

Rating: 4/10

#### W West Side

Law library :ok_hand:

Although the interior's quite different from everywhere else at UQ, walking in to the library can feel like you've just entered Hogwarts. The ambience is very nice especially when there's not a lot of people. I would suggest level 4 as a study area, but since I visited during the break I'm not sure how busy this area gets during semester.

Rating: 7/10

### 2 Duhig Tower

As with Central Library, the levels closer to the ground are usually quite busy during semester, but level 5 is extremely cosy (and big tables too). It is a very nice study space and I will have to look again during semester to see if it's busy or not.

Rating: 8/10

### 3 Steele Building

yes

### 4 The Bookshop

...there's an interior area? I thought it was just ezy mart and wordsmiths' cafe. must explore.

### 5 Richards Building

No idea what this is. must explore

### 6 Physics Annexe

It's just a long corridor filled with offices on either side on all floors. There's also the quantum systems thingy here but authorised access only. Not much notable.

Rating: 4/10

### 7 Parnell Building

Level 1 and Level 2 are okay, mainly tutorial rooms and lecture hall. Not a study area. Not sure what's on Level 3 though - must explore.

Current rating (to be updated): 5/10

### 8 Goddard Building

Haven't been here. Must explore

### 9 Michie Building

Anthropology stuff is all here. Majority of the higher floors are just offices and desks with a few isolated tut rooms. There are a couple of seating areas with couches+tables+powerpoint. Would be nice as a study area if it's not too busy (just relocate to a higher floor, 8 storeys); however, it's quite far from where I usually am.
