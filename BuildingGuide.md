### 1 Forgan Smith Building

I'm splitting this into East and West sides of the building.

#### E East Side

East side has a lot of history/philosophy stuff. There's a nice "library" area on level 3 that has a lot of History books you can read, but it isn't really a study area. There is an eating area somewhere here but I cannot locate it on the map - must explore again in person.

Rating: 4/10

#### W West Side

Law library :ok_hand:

Although the interior's quite different from everywhere else at UQ, walking in to the library can feel like you've just entered Hogwarts. The ambience is very nice especially when there's not a lot of people. I would suggest level 4 as a study area, but since I visited during the break I'm not sure how busy this area gets during semester.

Rating: 7/10

### 2 Duhig Tower

As with Central Library, the levels closer to the ground are usually quite busy during semester, but level 5 is extremely cosy (and big tables too). It is a very nice study space and I will have to look again during semester to see if it's busy or not.

Rating: 8/10

### 3 Steele Building

yes

### 4 The Bookshop

...there's an interior area? I thought it was just ezy mart and wordsmiths' cafe. must explore.

### 5 Richards Building

No idea what this is. must explore

### 6 Physics Annexe

It's just a long corridor filled with offices on either side on all floors. There's also the quantum systems thingy here but authorised access only. Not much notable.

Rating: 4/10

### 7 Parnell Building

Level 1 and Level 2 are okay, mainly tutorial rooms and lecture hall. Not a study area. Not sure what's on Level 3 though - must explore.

Current rating (to be updated): 5/10

### 8 Goddard Building

Haven't been here. Must explore

### 9 Michie Building

Anthropology stuff is all here. Majority of the higher floors are just offices and desks with a few isolated tut rooms. There are a couple of seating areas with couches+tables+powerpoint. Would be nice as a study area if it's not too busy (just relocate to a higher floor, 8 storeys); however, it's quite far from where I usually am.

Rating: 6/10

### 11 James and Mary Emelia Mayne Centre (Art Museum)

The exhibitions here are pretty great, and it's free entry for everyone. There's a small study/eating area in the building next to the entrance but I wouldn't recommend as it's not quiet due to noises from outside and in the museum.

Rating: 7/10

### 12 Duhig North

(aka Central Library)

Usually very full during semester, levels 1-2 are not quiet. It would be nice to secure a spot on the higher levels but I wouldn't use it as a regular study spot.

Rating: 4/10

### 12A Duhig Link

why is this its own building lol, same rating as Duhig North

Rating: 4/10

### 14 Sir Llew Edwards Building

Level 1 is okay, haven't been to the other floors. Must explore

### 16 Radon Pavillion

...what?! what is this place? is this just a roofed area?! must explore...

### 17 Learning Innovation Building

No study spots here - just big seminar/conference rooms.

I dislike this building because from the outside, it looks like you can connect from there to Physics Annexe because they're at the same level. But, there's a 0.5m gap between them, and you can only get up there through the Physics Annexe tower thing. :cry:

Rating: 4/10

### 20 Global Change Institute Building

Very cool building, but not for study. Would highly recommend having a look, especially the observation room on level 0. There are some corridors connecting to Steele which are a good place to explore, but make sure you only go through rooms you can access.
