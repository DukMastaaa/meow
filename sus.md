the voices tell you to give in


"come, be one among us," they whisper into your evacuated mind, as you frantically try to stop your thoughts... stop the voices.. stop the impostor..
but it's no use.. your degenerate monke brain has devolved to such an extent that you now recognise non-amogus objects as amogus...


"hurr durr hehe fire extinguisher sus, dead body reported"


the people you love in your life start noticing some of your behavioural changes - you can't even eat at the dinner table without calling the spoon "mad sus"... they're confused and worried, without a clue of the extent that among us as infiltrated your mind


they tell you "sus? among us? impostor? what are you talking about, is this some kind of game?"


with astonishment cast over your face, you look at the collared shirt they're wearing...
"it's not just a game," you blurt out, eyes lit up with excitement
"they're everywhere. you don't understand, it's not just a game, the impostors!" you point to the shape of the collar on their shirt. "see?" you exclaim. "it makes an amogus! you're an impostor!"


your loved one's eyes spell out the definition of disappointment..
they sit down next to you and and voice their concerns.
"well, whoever this impostor is, they're not doing you any good. why not have something to eat? it's quite late and you haven't had your dinner.. maybe thatll help you feel a bit better."


you stay silent, with most of your mind concentrated on the red-coloured flower vase outside of your room. After realising the room has gone silent for a few moments time, you jolt back to reality and forcefully nod in agreement. they pay you on the back and sigh deeply while walking out of your door.


*don't listen to them*


*they're acting sus*


*emergency meeting*


the voices come again right after the door shuts.


*mini crewmate*


*electrical*


*faked task*


they start to overwhelm you<br>
threatening to take control


*there are 3 impostors remaining*


"three?! Still three?!" you exclaim, as mind races to narrow down the suspects remaining in your house.
"mom, dad, my two younger brothers, grandma.. who could it be?"


*leave the room*, the voice says. you, inundated with shock that there are still 3 impostors remaining, fully comply and spring out of your seat.


there's just dad in the living room, taking a phone call. you can hear him speaking.<br>
walking to the kitchen, mum's asking your younger brothers what they'd like for lunch tomorrow at school. "nothing wrong here," you repeat to yourself. you see mum preparing to boil some water on the kettle, and move on. <br>
grandma's asleep in her own room. you open the door, and notice that she hasn't packed away the book she was reading - it must have fallen off the bed onto the floor.
you think grandma had a long night and just fell asleep reading..


***sus.***


"what?!" you reply to the voice in your head.


***that's not normal, grandma acting sus, grandma impostor?!***


"noO-" you attempt to control it, but it's too STRONG


***EMERGENCY MEETING. NOW.***


you feel as if the voice comes from right behind you - each limb starts to crumble, being replaced by a deathly phantom sensation.


in a desperate attempt to regain control, you use your remaining effort to hit your head with your fist, hoping the voices disappear.


STRIKE


*...*


STRIKE


*..harder...*


STRIKE


*..hARDER*


STRIKE


*HARDER*


***STRIKE***


*HARDER*


the pain disables your thoughts
yet your hand continues to strike

Once more, twice more

you want to make it stop

three times, four times

it stops

now

you have lost control


you walk out of the room, grandma asleep, back into the kitchen
the kettle isn't boiling. there's no water inside at all.
you look out into the living room.
dad's holding the phone in his hand, but neither him or the other person are talking.


```
FIRE
PRESS HARD TO
BREAK GLASS
```


you see on the wall


***EMERGENCY BUTTON***


your consciousness takes a backseat in the cinema of your reality, as you watch yourself violently slam the fire alarm.
sprinklers start spraying water
and you hear the sirens blaring. the fire department is arriving.


in the midst of the chaos, your family gathers in the living room
"Why did you press the alarm?!", mum says.
"Leave the unit, get to safety!" dad says
the kids just scream.


you yell out at the top of your voice,
"YOU'RE SSUUUSSS!
GRANDMA DIDN'T PUT HER BOOK BACK, IMPOSTOR!
MUM FAKED BOIL TASK! FAKED VISUAL TASK, THE KETTLE DIDN'T EVEN BOIL! DAD SUS, FAKING ADMIN!"


just as your words leave your mouth, the fire department barge into your unit and evacuate everyone in the building
as your family rush out due to the panic, you stand in the centre of the living room, with a huge grin from cheek to cheek
people call out to you - get out, get out!


"***no...***"

the word doesn't even feel like yours.


pushing away the firefighters who run towards you to help, you use a glass-breaking tool dropped from the panic and throw it against the apartment window..


"NO! COME BACK!" they all scream. but they're impostors, you see - all sus!


bolting straight for the window, you shout 
***WHEN THE IMPOSTOR IS SUS***
as the glass breaks.
there's nothing to stop your fall.


time slows down, slowly but inevitably counting down to your inevitable death


"what happened," you think to yourself
"why am I falling?"
"have I been ejected?"
"maybe i was the impostor.. all along.."


your legs feel an immense pain
your body crumbles
your head hits the ground
time stops.
